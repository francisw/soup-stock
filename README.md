## Description

Soup Stock is a tool to install a new copy of stock

## Installation

This is a standard Wordpress plugin, and is installed using the wp-admin plugin installer.

1. Install a new clean copy of Wordpress. Do not do anything else to it except this.
2. Download the latest Source code(zip) from our [Github](https://github.com/francisw/soup-release/release) repository
3. In the wp-admin dashoard panel select Plugins->Add New
4. Click Upload and select the zip file you downloaded for this plugin
5. Click Activate - Your Wordpress installation will now be replaced with Vacation Soup Stock


## Usage

This is an unattended plugin. Just activate it and it will install the Vacation Soup Stock. 

When it is complete, your page will automatically refresh with your new site. 
Log in (add /wp-admin to the url) with the credentials you used to create the Wordpress website, and start building your site.


## Common problems

This only works on a clean, brand new installation of Wordpress. If you have done anything in Wordpress other than install this plugin, it will not run in order to protect what you have done. To correct this, delete your Wordpress installation and start again.
